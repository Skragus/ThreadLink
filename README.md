# 🧵 Threadlink

**Condense and carry your AI sessions.**  
Threadlink turns long, chaotic AI chat transcripts into portable, structured context cards.

### 🚀 What It Does
- 📥 Paste raw conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.
- 🧠 Summarizer drones compress the full session into a lightweight context card
- 📤 Copy and reuse across tools—preserve flow, avoid starting from scratch

### 🎯 Why It Matters
LLMs forget. Threadlink doesn't.  
Keep continuity across platforms. Build memory into your workflow.

### 🛠 Features
- 🧩 Drone-based summarization pipeline
- ⚖️ Recency-weighted compression (recent = more detailed)
- 💾 BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) — supports OpenAI, Gemini, Claude
- 🛡️ Privacy-first — all processing is local/client-side
- 🌐 Deployed at [**threadlink.xyz**](https://threadlink.xyz)

### 🧪 How It Works
1. Input conversation → split into chunks
2. Each chunk → passed to a "drone" (LLM summarizer)
3. Outputs into a single context card with headers
4. Done. Paste it anywhere. Context restored.
