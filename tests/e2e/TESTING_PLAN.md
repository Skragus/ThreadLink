Of course. Based on the final master list, here is an extensive list of suggested missing tests, designed to overdeliver on quantity and cover granular edge cases. Each suggestion is a single, actionable sentence.

---

### **1. Persistence Recovery**
*   Verify API keys are correctly re-populated in the input fields after a page reload when persistence was enabled.
*   Test that all advanced settings (Temperature, Drone Density, etc.) are restored to their last saved values on a cold start.
*   Ensure the application gracefully handles loading when `localStorage` data has been manually corrupted or is in an invalid format.
*   Confirm that switching to a browser's private/incognito mode does not crash the app when it tries to access storage.
*   Test the application's behavior when a new version is deployed that expects a different `localStorage` schema.
*   Verify that if a user revokes storage permissions mid-session, the application does not crash on the next action.
*   Ensure that an in-progress job's state is completely cleared on reload and does not enter a "zombie" state.
*   Test multi-tab consistency by changing a setting in one tab and reloading another to see if it updates.

### **2. Offline-First & Network Behavior**
*   Verify that launching the app offline displays a clear "You are offline" banner or message to the user.
*   Test that all processing-related buttons are disabled and have appropriate tooltips when the app is launched offline.
*   Ensure the application correctly detects when the network connection is restored and re-enables online functionality.
*   Simulate a network drop *during* an active drone batch and verify the UI updates to a failed or paused state.
*   Test the app's resilience on a high-latency, "flaky" network that is not fully disconnected.
*   Verify that trying to open the API key modal while offline does not trigger any network-related errors.
*   Confirm the app does not enter an infinite loading state if a critical initial config fetch fails.

### **3. Backend Health Check**
*   Test the UI state when the main API endpoint is available but the model provider (e.g., OpenAI) is down.
*   Verify there is a finite number of retries for the initial backend health check before showing a permanent error.
*   Ensure the UI correctly updates from a "backend down" state to "ready" without requiring a page refresh if the backend comes online.

### **4. Processing Pipeline & Resilience**
*   Verify that the delay between retries increases, confirming exponential backoff is implemented.
*   Test that the pipeline correctly terminates and shows a final error after exceeding the maximum number of retries.
*   Ensure the UI displays a "Retrying (2 of 3)..." message to the user during a retry cycle.
*   Test processing a document that consists of a single, unbroken paragraph of 5 million characters.
*   Verify the structural integrity of a document with thousands of deeply nested markdown bullet points.
*   Test a document containing a mix of every supported code block language and complex Unicode symbols.
*   Ensure the system gracefully handles a drone that returns a non-JSON or malformed response.
*   Verify the behavior when a drone returns a completely empty but successful (200 OK) response.
*   Test the scenario where a user's custom prompt is so long it exhausts the token limit for any user input.
*   Confirm that an input text longer than the model's maximum context window is handled with a clear error.
*   Test the pipeline's handling of drones returning their results wildly out of their original processing order.

### **5. Settings Modal & Advanced Configuration**
*   Test entering non-numeric characters into the "LLM Temperature" or "Max Drones" input fields.
*   Verify that inputting a value outside the accepted range (e.g., Temperature of 5) shows a validation error.
*   Ensure submitting an empty "Custom System Prompt" after enabling it either reverts to default or shows a validation error.
*   Test rapidly enabling and disabling the "Use Custom Prompt" toggle between processing runs to check for state corruption.

### **6. API Key Management**
*   Test saving a new API key, closing the modal, reopening it, and successfully overwriting the key with a new value.
*   Inspect `localStorage` in the browser's developer tools to verify API keys are not being stored in plaintext.
*   Test for key leakage by inspecting network request headers to ensure keys are not being passed as insecure parameters.
*   Verify a user-friendly error is shown if saving a key fails because the browser's storage quota is exceeded.

### **7. Security & Input Hardening**
*   Craft an adversarial prompt attempting to make the model reveal its own "system prompt" instructions.
*   Test for token-level prompt injection by placing instructions inside long, seemingly normal text.
*   Use Unicode confusables (homoglyphs) in an input to try and bypass security filters.
*   Test for ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) by feeding crafted input to the text splicer.
*   Verify that a user cannot inject instructions that change the behavior of a subsequent run in a multi-turn context.
*   Attempt to inject a markdown link that uses a `javascript:` URI to test sanitization.

### **8. Performance & Load Testing**
*   Simulate 50 concurrent users initiating a large processing job at the exact same moment to test the backend queue.
*   Measure the degradation in average processing time per job as the number of concurrent users increases.
*   Profile the client-side DOM rendering speed when the final output is extremely large (e.g., 50,000 lines).
*   Test the backend's behavior when it receives more concurrent requests than the configured `Max Drones Limit`.

### **9. Mobile & Responsive Design**
*   Verify the application correctly handles an orientation change from portrait to landscape mid-processing.
*   Test the app's UI and responsiveness while simulating a slow 3G network connection on a mobile device.
*   Ensure an incoming phone call or app-switching does not cause the processing state to be lost.
*   Verify that text selection and context menus within the text editor are functional on touch devices.

### **10. Accessibility (A11y)**
*   Test with a screen reader to ensure it announces dynamic UI updates like "Processing started," "Drone 2/5 failed," and "Processing complete."
*   Verify that all form inputs in the Settings and API Key modals have correctly associated labels for screen readers.
*   Ensure the logical focus order follows the visual layout when tabbing through all interactive elements.
*   Confirm that all error messages are tied to an `aria-live` region so they are announced automatically.


Yes, this information provides a final, crucial clarification.

**This does not fundamentally change the major strategic gaps**, but it provides deep confidence in the *quality and stability of the existing tests*. Essentially, it confirms that the scaffolding is rock-solid. The helpers are the tools, and while they show the *capability* to test certain things (like offline mode), they don't count as coverage until a test actually uses them for that purpose.

The one significant change this information provides is that it confirms **"General Console Error Guards" are a deliberate, system-wide feature of the test suite**, not just a one-off check. I will update the master list to reflect this.

After incorporating this final piece, I can now present the truly definitive master file. The analysis is complete.

***

### **Executive Summary**

The test suite has achieved a high level of maturity, supported by a robust and comprehensive set of E2E helper utilities. This foundation ensures that existing tests are stable, deterministic, and well-architected.

The application's frontend is heavily hardened. Core pipeline mechanics are validated at both the E2E and unit-test levels. Critical race conditions and security vectors have been addressed.

The remaining gaps are now crystal clear and confirmed to be outside the scope of the current tooling's primary use. The path forward is unambiguously focused on three areas:
1.  **Complete State Persistence (E2E):** End-to-end verification of all settings and keys being saved and restored across sessions.
2.  **Systemic Backend Resilience:** Stress-testing the backend for advanced recovery patterns and high-concurrency load.
3.  **True Offline Experience:** Using the available network helpers to build tests for the offline launch and usage scenarios.
