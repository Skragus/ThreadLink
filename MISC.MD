Bragi's multifaceted project explores AI-powered conversation summarization via "Threadlink", a tool converting lengthy AI interactions into dense context cards. Developed during night shifts in Iceland's volcanic region, the project leverages cheap LLMs for text processing, focusing on modular design and format-agnostic text cleaning.

Key objectives include:
‚Ä¢ Build a universal web novel text cleaner
‚Ä¢ Create personalized audiobook generation
‚Ä¢ Develop a memory-aware AI assistant ("Solace")

Technical approach involves breaking complex problems into sub-tasks, using multiple LLM "drones" for summarization, and implementing a two-layer memory architecture. The project balances technical innovation with personal utility, shifting from game development to building pragmatic tools.

Hackathon strategy targets a web app MVP supporting major AI platforms, with a minimalist UI emphasizing functionality over design. Core features include paste-based API key handling, conversation condensation, and browser-local processing.

Underlying philosophy: transform AI interaction from session-based exchanges to a continuous, context-aware narrative experience.

üßµ Threadlink Dev Status: Environment Migration Challenges

Current Focus: Resolving Node.js environment inconsistencies between development machines

Key Issues Encountered:
- Package configuration conflicts (CommonJS vs ESM)
- Missing dependencies (dotenv)
- Undefined variable handling in statistics logging

Immediate Actions:
- Standardize package.json configuration
- Install Node.js dependencies with npm
- Implement safe number formatting
- Create robust error handling for undefined values

Environment Differences:
- Laptop: Forgiving runtime, working configuration
- Desktop: Strict Node.js v22, exposing latent issues

Next Steps:
- Normalize environment configuration
- Add defensive programming techniques
- Verify drone pipeline functionality across machines

Unresolved: Precise source of sessionStats undefined values during context card generation

Recommendation: Implement comprehensive null/undefined checks and provide default values to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's a condensed context card capturing the key technical details and troubleshooting insights:

# Drone Pipeline: Module & Configuration Debugging

## Key Issues
‚Ä¢ Missing AI SDK modules (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
‚Ä¢ Potential dotenv configuration conflict
‚Ä¢ API key retrieval challenges

## Quick Fixes
```bash
# One-liner to install all required SDKs
npm install openai @anthropic-ai/sdk @google/generative-ai

# Ensure Node.js dotenv, not Python version
npm install dotenv
```

## API Key Retrieval
‚Ä¢ Direct link: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
‚Ä¢ Avoid GCP enterprise onboarding
‚Ä¢ Use `.env` format: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here`

## Debugging Checklist
1. Verify Node.js dotenv installation
2. Check .env file permissions
3. Confirm API keys are correctly formatted
4. Validate module import paths

Recommended: Restart development environment after changes.

Here's a condensed, ultra-dense summary capturing the critical context:

üîë Dotenv Troubleshooting Sequence: Persistent .env loading issue with unexpected GOOGLE_API_KEY="no". Potential causes: mislocated .env file, system environment variable interference, or hidden configuration problem. Diagnostic steps include:

1. Force explicit .env path loading:
```javascript
require('dotenv').config({ 
  path: path.resolve(__dirname, '.env') 
});
```

2. Debug file location & contents:
```javascript
console.log('Current .env path:', path.resolve(__dirname, '.env'));
console.log('File exists:', fs.existsSync(path.resolve(__dirname, '.env')));
console.log('File contents:', fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, '.env'), 'utf8'));
```

3. Verify environment variable source:
- Check process.env directly
- Inspect all loaded environment variables
- Confirm no system-level interference

Recommended immediate actions:
- Reinstall dotenv
- Verify .env file permissions
- Use absolute path loading
- Print comprehensive debug information

Potential root causes: filesystem path confusion, unexpected environment variable inheritance, dotenv module misconfiguration.

üîç Context: Domain DNS Configuration & Deployment

Troubleshooting threadlink.xyz domain resolution after recent nameserver changes. Domain purchased via IONOS, delegated to Netlify's DNS (dns1.p06.nsone.net).

Current Status:
- Domain not resolving
- Potential DNS propagation delay
- Possible caching/resolver issues

Diagnostic Steps:
1. Wait 30-90 minutes for full DNS propagation
2. Verify Netlify domain settings
3. Check global DNS resolution via dnschecker.org
4. Confirm both root (@) and www domains configured

Recommended Actions:
- Verify Netlify custom domain settings
- Ensure proper domain redirects
- Check DNS propagation status
- Potentially flush local DNS cache

Next Phase: Backend deployment on GCP VM with Express server for ThreadLink project.
