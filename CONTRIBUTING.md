# Contributing to ThreadLink

ThreadLink is an open source project primarily released for educational and transparency purposes under the MIT license. Since this is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) application with client-side processing, we've made the source code available for:

1. Security auditing - So users can verify no data leaves their browser
2. Educational purposes - To demonstrate client-side LLM processing techniques  
3. Transparency - To build trust with our users

## Current Contribution Status

While the project is open source, we are currently **not actively seeking contributions** as this is primarily a showcase project. However, we appreciate your interest and welcome:

- Bug reports via GitHub Issues
- Security vulnerability reports
- Feature suggestions

## Running Locally

If you want to run ThreadLink locally:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to the localhost URL shown in the terminal

## API Keys

ThreadLink is a BYOK application, meaning:
- You must provide your own API keys to use the application
- API keys are only stored in your browser's localStorage (if you opt-in)
- No data is ever sent to our servers

## Security

If you discover any security issues, please report them via GitHub Issues.
