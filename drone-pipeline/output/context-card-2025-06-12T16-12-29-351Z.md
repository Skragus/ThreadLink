# Threadlink Context Card
Source size: 43.935 tokens ‚Üí Final size: 1.021 tokens (target: 3.000 tokens)
Compression Ratio: 43.0:1 | Drones: 9

Bragi, waking at 4:30 AM, discussed ThreadLink demo completion with ChatGPT.  A key UI change: replacing the unstable token target with intuitive compression levels (1-5, 1-10, Max),  while retaining internal token targeting for optimal drone resource allocation;  backend commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run backend`, `cd server`, `npm run start`) were also reviewed.

---

Originally, Vite powered the frontend; the backend, in `/api` or `/server`, used `nodemon` or `ts-node`.  The user debugged a directory issue, running `nodeserver.js`.  The conversation then focused on "Kernel," a self-hosted metadata tracker, and "ThreadLink," a content-aware layer using LLMs for context card generation.  The architecture prioritizes a clean separation of data storage (KernelCore) and AI processing (KernelSynthesis), enabling BYOK and efficient summarization.

If you want, I can sketch "ThreadLink MVP Cache Lite."  The demo is the real build;  caching, BYOK, settings persistence are all production-grade. Use localStorage for settings, IndexedDB for context cards, and sessionStorage for active sessions.  The drone relaunch system is feature bloat; scrap it.  Finish early.  Kernel's power is logging events; build a Telegram bot for ingestion.  Support Telegram and Discord bots for developer-native ingestion.

---

Open-sourcing a Telegram bot simplifies KernelCore adoption, serving as a living spec reference.  A phased approach‚ÄîTelegram bot, Discord bot, CLI client, SDKs, and connectors‚Äîbuilds a developer ecosystem.  The CLI client, a Node.js or Python script, enables scriptable ingestion, bridging to full SDKs later.  KernelCore (Python) remains decoupled from language-neutral clients.  This strategy prioritizes a developer-first ingestion standard, not just an app.

---

You're building crucial AI infrastructure, not a SaaS product; Kernel's self-hosted, dev-first approach, focusing on ingestion, is unique.  Key features include open ingestion protocols, BYO storage/models/keys, and optional hosted versions later.  This strategy prioritizes developer adoption, building trust through data ownership and control, unlike competitors.  The long-term vision is a protocol, not data ownership, ensuring lasting relevance.

---

You're building Kernel, a protocol founder, not a SaaS founder;  focus on infrastructure, not immediate monetization.  Kernel's structure mirrors Stripe's, but its leverage comes from controlling ingestion rails, not transaction fees.  KernelCore stores raw, timestamped events; KernelSynthesis interprets and prepares data for LLMs.  Kernel provides external state for stateless LLMs, solving their context weakness.

---

Let‚Äôs slice it precisely: KernelCore atomically ingests events via POST /ingest; KernelSynthesis pulls context from KernelCore for LLMs.  Adapters filter events, preventing micro-event floods.  Retrofitting adapters extract, normalize, and ingest from existing services (APIs, scraping, exports); native adapters integrate directly.  Protocol documentation, reference adapters, and SDKs enable community contributions.

üì¶Deployment: serverless, local, Kernel plugin, community hubs.  üè∑Ô∏èExample: Kindle Cloud Reader adapter (DOM scraping, chapter increase filter, JSON normalization). üß™Testing: local mocks, schema validation (Kernel validator), dry runs. üß©Bonus: community adapter marketplace (open-source modules). ‚ö†Ô∏èKernelCore schema-first; adapters adapt to it, not vice-versa.  ‚úÖSummary: adapters handle data source complexity; KernelCore remains clean.  This enables a thriving adapter ecosystem.

Kernel, a personal data management system, decouples AI models from user data, allowing control over data location (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or local LLaMA).  Users control data sharing and processing;  casual users utilize OpenAI, while privacy-focused users employ local models.  Kernel prioritizes state permanence over content interpretation, empowering users to enforce their preferred privacy levels, unlike SaaS AI tools.  The system's modular design enables adaptability and future-proofing.
