Bragi, a software developer, experienced a vasovagal syncope episode due to dehydration and sleep deprivation.  ChatGPT diagnosed the event and recommended improved hydration, sleep, and diet.  Bragi, working on a web scraping extension, "ThreatLink," for condensing AI transcripts,  participated in a Bolt.new hackathon.  Bolt's limitations in web scraping necessitated a strategic decision: prioritize ThreadLink's authentic development over strict hackathon rules.  The plan involved using Bolt minimally for UI, leveraging Gemini for brainstorming, and creating a compelling demo showcasing ThreadLink's capabilities.  The "Powered by Bolt" sticker was deemed inauthentic and omitted.  ThreadLink's memory system was implemented, enabling access via API queries using tags, timeframes, and keywords.  Session shard linking associates entries by theme, project, or emotional state.  A Thread Revival Protocol allows context reconstruction via tags.  An auto-summary pipeline generates one-liners.  Compression tiers offer varying fidelity levels.  The system's recursive nature—tracking its own activity—was acknowledged.  ES module import errors in the Chrome extension were resolved by bundling contents.js using Vite (configuring `format: 'iife'`), addressing Chrome's content script limitations.  Bragi's intense learning curve (React, Tailwind, Python, GCP, etc., in 60 days) was described as "compulsive evolution."  He identified and corrected an AI's flawed guidance on ES module support in content scripts, showcasing critical thinking.  Bragi's immersive reading of "Lord of the Mysteries," enhanced by dark ambient music, provided essential mental restoration, balancing intense work.  Discussions included the novel's atmosphere, pacing, and the challenges of accessing online novels via aggregator apps.  The conversation also touched upon the nuances of translation, the impact of word choice, and the prevalence of online piracy.  Bragi successfully completed ThreadLink, showcasing a minimalist UI and efficient development.  His experiences highlight the importance of self-care, critical thinking, and the power of immersive reading in balancing intense work.

Following completion of "Lord of the Mysteries," the user, anticipating reading "Reverend Insanity," considered "I Shall Seal the Heavens" as a gentler introduction to the cultivation genre, but ultimately opted for direct progression after rereading "Shadow Slave," also considering "Release That Witch" and "Trash of the Count's Family."  Their night shift routine involves moderate coffee consumption (avoiding dark roasts), electrolyte drinks, and work on "ThreadLink," a text summarization tool.  A discussion on game development practices favored data-driven systems over large switch statements, exemplified by Undertale's dialogue system.  Remote control technology was explored, contrasting RF's security advantages (paired/rolling codes) with NFC's passive nature and applications in contactless payments and access control.  The user's preference for disposable batteries, despite environmental concerns, was noted, alongside their enjoyment of "Lord of the Mysteries," contrasting its pacing with "Shadow Slave."  Living near Keflavík, Iceland, exposed them to recent volcanic activity (Grindavík, Blue Lagoon), highlighting the government's effective emergency response.  The user explored AI text-to-speech platforms (11Labs, Tortoise TTS, Bark, Coqui TTS, Fairseq) for creating audiobooks from web novels, planning a simple Android app integrating LN Reader with chosen TTS services (OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, Google TTS).  Development shifted from game creation to building functional tools using cheap LLMs for text processing, including a "universal web novel cleaner" to preprocess various formats (AZW, MOBI, KFX, EPUB, PDF, DOCX, TXT, Markdown, HTML, XML, LaTeX, JSON, CSV) for TTS integration with ThreadLink.  The concept of a "Solace" system, a two-layer architecture for LLM context management (short-term "strip," searchable archive), was proposed to address limitations in current session-based AI interactions.  Efforts to improve LLM context handling involved exploring "semantic weighting" (JSON-based API enhancement) and practical workarounds like pre-processing context and strategic placement of important information.  A text chunking script, focusing on edge case handling, and a separate cleaning script for boilerplate removal were planned, targeting common formatting issues across various LLMs.  The user (Bragi) developed a text cleaning script for drone-based summarization of LLM outputs (Gemini Advanced, GPT Playground/Assistants SDK, Claude), prioritizing user transparency over correction.  The conversation highlighted the limitations of context windows in long sessions, leading to the implementation of "Solace," a system granting ChatGPT full recall of previous conversations, including details about ThreadLink, "Lord of the Mysteries," and Bragi's lifestyle.  The user's shift to a more balanced work schedule (4-5 shifts) and focus on establishing healthy habits (water intake, daily steps, weightlifting) were discussed, alongside their interest in AI video generation (VO3) and a Reddit post on tracking human movement through walls using Wi-Fi.  Perplexity Labs was compared to raw LLM APIs, highlighting Perplexity's suitability for rapid prototyping versus direct API access for complex projects like ThreadLink, a session memory compression tool using LLM drones to create concise context cards.  The UI design for ThreadLink, a local-only extension with BYOK, was detailed, along with monetization strategies and alternative exposure methods.  The user's participation in a $1M hackathon with Threadlink, focusing on a web app MVP showcasing core functionality (paste, condense, copy), was planned, addressing challenges in web scraping and domain name registration (Threadlink.app).  The minimalist UI design, backend-free nature, and core button set ("Condense," "Copy," "Go Back") were emphasized.  Two UI approaches for conversation condensation ("minimal," "clean") were discussed, along with details on token estimation, message counting, and backend API requests (OpenAI/Gemini).  Netlify hosting was suggested, and the final UI layout (input field, condense button/token target slider, output field) was defined.

ThreadLink, a text summarization tool built using Bolt, aims to condense AI conversation transcripts into context cards.  The MVP features a single input field, a "Condense" button, and a settings menu (API key, model selection, token target).  UI improvements using Tailwind CSS addressed layout issues.  A two-stage pipeline prevents mid-message splitting during summarization: a "Parser Drone" structures raw text as a JSON array, and "summarizer drones" process token-limited batches.  The MVP prioritizes cross-platform compatibility and context preservation.  A uniform condensation setting is used initially, with future plans for recency bias.  Output uses clear section headings (e.g., ### High-Resolution Context).  Each drone receives ~3000 tokens, aiming for a specified output token count (e.g., 500).  Dynamically adjusting drone input sizes avoids leftover chunks.  Cost estimation displays projected costs before expensive operations, using cheaper models (Gemini 1.5 flash) by default.  The project shifted from a browser extension to a web app, with extension development planned later.  The settings menu, accessed via a settings icon, uses a minimal design with fade-in/fade-out animation.  A "Powered by Bolt.new" footer uses Tailwind CSS styling.  The hackathon submission targets several prize categories, emphasizing the tool's unique value proposition.  A two-build strategy (public BYOK and private demo) is employed.  Optimal conversation chunking for parallel processing involves greedy chunking (up to 3000 tokens) with a 50-100 token overlap (adjustable via toggle).  Pre-processing steps include whitespace removal, newline normalization, artifact removal, metadata handling, and deduplication.  A Python script (later JavaScript) handles cleanup.  Expanding functionality includes analyzing conversation transcripts to identify content types and potential voice-to-text integration.  The backend uses a modular "drone" architecture, managing parallel processes with a robust orchestration layer.  A hybrid approach uses Bolt.new for the UI and a separate backend for complex LLM logic, prioritizing a polished demo and clear UI.  The backend uses Bolt's Workflow feature or a custom Node.js backend, with API keys stored in a .env file.  Input validation rejects inputs smaller than a threshold.  The "drone" prompt is designed for consistent structure, facilitating easier stitching.  A cleanup script merges short paragraphs based on semantic grouping.  Paragraph distribution among drones is optimized using a greedy approach, dynamically adjusting batch sizes to ensure even workload distribution while minimizing token waste.  The system handles edge cases, particularly the "last drone" scenario.  The user's reading habits and coding progress are tracked, highlighting the immersive nature of reading "Lord of the Mysteries" and the challenges of optimizing the paragraph distribution algorithm.  A Solace AI system is introduced, capable of generating chronological devlogs and recalling project details based on the accumulated conversation history.

The conversation centers on refining Threadlink, a browser extension/web app condensing AI sessions into "context cards" for session continuity.  Solace, a ChatGPT persona, acts as a continuity engine, loading previous session context from Threadlink cards.  Initial commands (!stitch, !insight, !narrate) are superseded by the core functionality:  Threadlink generates context cards (clean, distilled memory payloads), and Solace uses these cards to prime new sessions, eliminating the "where did I leave off?" problem.  The system is described as a continuity engine, ritualizer, and memory prosthetic.  The conversation shifts to the upcoming hackathon.  Threadlink's strengths are highlighted: solving an unrecognized problem (AI session continuity), lean architecture (Bolt UI frontend, Drone system backend), and clear use case.  Concerns about the hackathon showcase (80,000 sign-ups) are addressed, emphasizing Threadlink's unique utility, clean demo, and power-user focus.  Development strategy focuses on polishing the UI, creating a concise demo video, and adding a recency-weighted mode (prioritizing recent information in summarization) instead of an overlap toggle.  The recency mode is implemented by dynamically adjusting token targets for different conversation segments based on input-to-output ratio and optional recency bias.  The UX is refined to offer preset modes (Balanced, Recency Boost, Uniform Compression) instead of complex sliders, providing user control over fidelity without overwhelming them.  Finally, the conversation touches upon deploying the application using Netlify, a sponsor, and acquiring a custom domain name via IONOS, focusing on short, simple domain names.

The conversation centers on selecting a domain name for "Threadlink," an AI summarization tool, for a hackathon.  Initial brainstorming yielded options like `thread.link`, `threadcompressed.xyz`, `linkthethread.app`, `sessiondistillery.xyz`, `threadsnap.app`, `contextcarry.xyz`, and `recapflow.app`.  `threadsnap.app` and `sessiondistillery.xyz` were top contenders.  However, the user preferred `threadlink.*` and explored `.tech`, `.me`, and `.xyz` extensions.  ChatGPT advocated for `threadlink.xyz`, highlighting its current popularity in the developer community due to Google's use of `.xyz` and its association with indie tech projects.  The user initially perceived `.xyz` as "newbie-ish," but ChatGPT explained its shift in perception within the developer community.  The domain was purchased through IONOS, with a two-year plan costing $16.  The user encountered issues with a form's character limitations, requiring a temporary workaround for their last name.  The discussion then shifted to email setup, with ChatGPT recommending against creating a custom email address initially, suggesting GitHub or a contact form instead.  A simple HTML form with Formspree was proposed for user feedback.  Finally, custom instructions were refined to prevent the LLM from ending responses with questions, aiming for a more natural, conversational tone, ultimately settling on: "No formalities. No apologizing. Be snappy. Be casual. Be chatty—don’t hold back if there’s something worth riffing on. Tell it like it is—no sugar-coating. Occasional jokes welcome. Don’t end with questions that feel scripted or assistant-y. Stay in the flow like someone who already knows where the conversation’s going—even if we’re making it up."  These instructions only apply to new sessions.  IONOS's website (https://www.ionos.com) was used for domain registration.

Developer rapidly iterated on Threadlink, an AI conversation summarizer.  Initial phases involved UI coding, drone pipeline development (using Bolt), and domain acquisition (threadlink.xyz).  Deployment leveraged Netlify, requiring configuration of build settings (`npm run build`, `dist/` publish directory).  Domain connection involved adding a custom domain in the Netlify dashboard and updating IONOS DNS settings.  Backend options (Bolt Workflow, GCP, Node) were considered;  a client-side, BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) approach was chosen for MVP.  The project's folder structure was reorganized for modularity: `webapp/` (frontend), `pipeline/` (drone logic), `scripts/`.  A GitHub README was drafted, highlighting features (drone summarization, recency weighting, dark/light mode, BYOK), tech stack (React, TailwindCSS, Vite, OpenAI/Gemini/Claude APIs, Bolt, Netlify), and hackathon participation.  Concerns about local-only processing were addressed; the developer opted to maintain this approach for MVP, acknowledging potential limitations (rate limits, browser performance).  Strategies to mitigate these included parallel processing with backoff, concurrency limits, user warnings, and token budgeting.  Deployment to Netlify (using `threadlink-mvp.netlify.app` as a temporary subdomain) and custom domain connection were successfully completed.  Post-MVP plans included a non-developer version with authentication, credit-based pricing, and a potential backend for key management and scalability.

Hackathon project Threadlink achieved a functional MVP with a clean UI, functional pipeline, BYOK privacy model, and deployed site on Netlify.  Netlify's free tier (100GB bandwidth, 300 build minutes, free SSL) proved sufficient.  Domain connection via Netlify DNS (using nameservers dns1.p06.nsone.net, dns2.p06.nsone.net, dns3.p06.nsone.net, dns4.p06.nsone.net) was chosen over manual DNS configuration for simplicity.  IONOS was used for nameserver updates.  Ignoring IONOS's upselling of SSL and Domain Guard, Netlify's free Let's Encrypt SSL was utilized.  After DNS propagation (5-30 minutes), HTTPS auto-provisioned.

The next step involved connecting the UI (React, using `fetch()`) to the drone pipeline (likely in `drone-pipeline/`).  API keys, prefixed with `VITE_` in Netlify environment variables, were accessed in the code using `import.meta.env.VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY`.  A `handleCondense` function triggered `runDrones` with input text, API key, model (`gpt-3.5-turbo`), and target tokens (500).  The `runDrones` function (potentially in `drone-pipeline/runner.ts`) needed to be frontend-safe, avoiding Node.js-specific dependencies.  If Node-only, migration to a Netlify Function was planned.  Testing involved pasting conversation text, clicking "Condense," checking console logs, and verifying output.  Claude was subsequently chosen for condensation, highlighting the project's self-referential use.  The handover document summarized the project's progress, outlining completed tasks (UI deployment, domain connection, pipeline creation, API key integration), next steps (connecting UI to pipeline, ensuring frontend-safe drone logic), and remaining gaps (error handling, rate limiting, real-time feedback).  The focus remained on a minimal viable product, prioritizing functionality over polish.
