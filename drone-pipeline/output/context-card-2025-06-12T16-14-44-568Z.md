# Threadlink Context Card
Source size: 43.935 tokens → Final size: 1.086 tokens (target: 3.000 tokens)
Compression Ratio: 40.5:1 | Drones: 9

Bragi, waking at 4:30 AM, discussed ThreadLink's demo completion with ChatGPT.  A key UI change: replacing the unstable token target with intuitive compression levels (1-5, 1-10, Max),  hiding complex token targeting logic in advanced settings while maintaining it internally for optimal drone resource allocation.  ChatGPT provided backend commands (`npm run dev`, `npm run backend`, `cd server`, `npm run start`) for debugging.

Originally, Vite powered the frontend; the backend, in `/api` or `/server`, used `nodemon` or `ts-node`.  The user debugged a directory issue, running `nodeserver.js`.  The conversation then focused on "Kernel," a metadata-focused project, and "ThreadLink," a content-processing layer.  The user planned Kernel's self-hosting, BYOK model integration, and efficient LLM usage, aiming for low latency via pre-computed caches and asynchronous processing.  A 360,000-token test resulted in a 1:15 compression ratio.  The user finalized a compression setting sequence (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, Max) and discussed caching strategies for the demo build.

If you want, I can sketch "ThreadLink MVP Cache Lite."  The demo is the real build; caching, BYOK, settings persistence are crucial. Use localStorage for settings, IndexedDB for context cards, and sessionStorage for active sessions.  The drone relaunch system is feature bloat; scrap it.  Finish early, then focus on Kernel, starting with a Telegram bot for ingestion.  This developer-native approach is key.

---

Open-sourcing a Telegram bot simplifies KernelCore adoption; it acts as a living spec and starter pack.  A phased rollout—Telegram bot, Discord bot, CLI client, SDKs, connectors—builds a developer ecosystem.  The CLI, a Node.js or Python script, enables scriptable ingestion, bridging to full SDKs later.  KernelCore (Python) remains decoupled from language-neutral clients.

---

You're building crucial AI infrastructure, not a SaaS product; Kernel's self-hosted, dev-first approach, focusing on ingestion APIs and open protocols, is unique.  This strategy prioritizes developer adoption by offering control and avoiding data lock-in, mirroring successful self-hosted tools like PostHog and Supabase.  A multi-faceted deployment model (personal, web app, managed services) will emerge organically.  The initial focus is on a minimal viable product with a novel chat-powered onboarding system using context cards.

---

You're building Kernel, a protocol, not a SaaS product;  focus on infrastructural leverage, not immediate monetization.  KernelCore stores raw, timestamped events; KernelSynthesis interprets and provides context to stateless LLMs.  Developers build adapters, extending Kernel's schema.  This creates a powerful, scalable system.

---

Let’s slice it precisely: KernelCore atomically ingests events via POST /ingest; KernelSynthesis pulls context from KernelCore for LLMs.  Adapters filter events, preventing micro-action floods.  Retrofitting adapters extract, normalize, and ingest from existing services using APIs, scraping, or exports; native adapters integrate directly.  Protocol documentation, reference adapters, and SDKs enable community contributions.

---

Deployment options include serverless functions, local execution, Kernel plugin integration, and community hubs.  A Kindle Cloud adapter example demonstrates data collection, filtering, normalization (e.g., {"event_type":"reading.progress", "chapter":300}), and ingestion via POST /api/ingest.  Testing involves local mocks, schema validation using Kernel's validator, and dry runs.  The KernelCore schema remains constant; adapters handle data source specifics.  A community adapter marketplace fosters open-source contributions.  The core principle is adapter adaptation to KernelCore, not vice-versa.

---

Kernel, a personal data management system, decouples AI models from user data, allowing flexible model selection (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, local LLaMA) and control over data privacy.  Users own their data pipeline, choosing processing location and sharing levels.  This contrasts with SaaS AI, where the provider owns the data.  Kernel prioritizes durable personal state, not content control, empowering users to enforce their desired privacy levels.  The system's strength lies in its protocol-based approach, enabling adaptability and user sovereignty.
