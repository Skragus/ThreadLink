85. Ah! The issue is clear now. The stats bot is receiving the !status command (and throwing "command not found"), which means the control bot isn't running or isn't connected properly.

86. Let's check:
1. Is the control bot actually running?

87. bash

88. # Check if it's running
ps aux | grep controlbot

89. # Check tmux sessions
tmux ls | grep controlbot

90. 2. If it's running, check the controlbot logs:

bash
# If running in tmux
tmux attach -t controlbot

91. # Or check the output directly
tail -f ~/noema/controlbot.log  # if you're logging to file

92. 3. Most likely issues:
A. Control bot isn't starting properly

99. Let me help them check what's happening with the control bot.

100. Good - the control bot IS running (PID 54912), but it's not in tmux and we can't see its output. Let's check what's happening:
1. Kill the current process and restart with output:

bash

101. # Kill the existing process
kill 54912

102. # Start it directly to see output
cd ~/noema
source venv/bin/activate
python controlbot.py

103. This will show you any errors or connection messages.
2. Most likely issues:
A. Wrong Bot Token
