#      ThreadLink Autonomous Loop - GCP PROVISIONER
# ==============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   To be run on your GCP server AFTER cloning the project repository.
#   This script installs dependencies, sets up the .env file, and installs
#   Playwright browsers, making the environment ready for the test loop.
#
# USAGE:
#   1. SSH into your GCP instance.
#   2. Clone your project: git clone <your-repo-url>
#   3. cd <your-project-directory>
#   4. Run this script: ./provision_gcp_runner.sh
